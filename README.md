# Overview
Fraud Detection is a project trained using Machine Learning to identify online transactions. The model was trained using Supervised Learning Algorithms like Decision Tree and Random Forest since the dataset already had labeled data.The model was evaluated using key metrics like confusion matrix. The accuracy of both the algorithms was :Decision Tree Score: 99.94947
Logistic Regression Score 99.91363.

## Dataset
* Source : The dataset is imported from Kaggle.The dataset consists of records like type of transaction,original and new balance of customer and recipient.
      It also includes record of Fraud transactions.

## Key Steps
* Model Training : Supervised Learning algorithms were used to train.
* Feature Engineering :
